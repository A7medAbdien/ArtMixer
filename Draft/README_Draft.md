# Post

Finally I am releasing a project - it is a 3D website, where you could mix two images!

The whole idea was to show that I finished this course,, but somehow it turned into a front-end project and involved many Blender tutorials.

However, I learned a lot, some of those many things:
1. Stick to CLASSIC projects. I really hated the idea of using my GPU that much.
2. While I enjoyed designing the website, I'm grateful to be a programmer and not an interior designer!



## five rooms

1. Uploading images
2. Run CoLab notebook as a backend service
3. Waiting room
4. show result of mixed images
5. credits


# Four walls

3. Collection, chair and table, plan blue
4. Waiting Room


# What remains

1. show REsult
2. Upload

                step: 0.01,
                joystick: 'invertY'
                // { "position": { "x": -0.7100000000000002, "y": 1.1, "z": 0.8099999999999996 } }
